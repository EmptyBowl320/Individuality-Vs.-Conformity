   <p>There are many symbols to be found in the collage featured on this page. Even though your explanation may not be the same as mine, it still probably is right. Some of the pictures scattered through out the collage are refrencing items that we have analyzed in the past. We already should know how they symbolize individuality or conformity. Should because some of of us may have already forgotten. Some of the pictures show how me and this project symbolize individuality vs. conformity. The numbers 1 and 4 show how most people (from what I know) chose choice 1 while I chose choice 4. The google docs/slides/sheets and the logo of VScode show the mediums of how everyone else(some of the others)made their projects(Ryan with the google slides story thingy and I think AJ using google docs) while I'm here trying to take my code and put into github so I can present it at school while I should be sleeping. In the end, it is the audience that asks themselves the question, "Which should be most highly valued individual or society?". Do I like the google docs story better or do I like the webpage better? Then you find the answer in the collage by finding your own meanings to all of the individual pictures and all of them at once. The quotes are quotes I found online. I looked exclusively for one that didn't have the authors name just because that gives meaning to the quote. Being an individual who does not care about his fame, just presenting a quote for people to think about. The other quote is written by a famous author that everyone knows about, Dr. Seuss. I believe that collages are meant for people to just make their own meaning to the madness of pictures. Make your own meaning to this collage. It will answer our question.</p>
